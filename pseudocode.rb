Take input from user
if input is empty(""), say "HELLO?"
if any letters in input are lowercase, say "I AM HAVING A HARD TIME HEARING YOU."
  probably use something where i can put a range of all lower case letters ex: [a-z]
if any letters are upercase, say "NO, THIS IS NOT A PET STORE"
  use the same range [A-Z]
if the input is "goodbye" find a way to count if that was the first time or second time is was recieved. Do this by using += 1
  within a loop. So each time it loops through it adds 1. 
    After the first "goodbye" program should say "ANYTHING ELSE I CAN HELP WITH?"
 when "goodbye" is recieved a second time the program needs to say "THANK YOU FOR CALLING!" and then exit. exit should heppen
   after the loop ends.
